The task involves classifying iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their measurements using a machine learning model. You will use the Iris dataset, which includes features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, to train the model. While the Scikit-learn library offers a built-in Iris dataset, you can also download an alternative version for the classification task.

The process involves the following steps:
	1.	Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand feature distribution and species separation.
	2.	Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting it into training and testing subsets.
	3.	Model Training: Use a machine learning algorithm like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forest to train the model.
	4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	5.	Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new iris measurements into one of the three species.
